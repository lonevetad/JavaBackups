	 * Upon being equipped to "someone" (i.e.: {@link BaseCreatureRPG} instance),

	 * perform some work and adjustment.<br>
	 * It's provided the {@link GModality} to let modifications to be applied and
	 * abilities ({@link EquipItemAbility}) to be activated. If it's needed the
	 * {@link BaseCreatureRPG}, which have the {@link EquipmentSet} where is
	 * equipped the {@link EquipmentItem} (returned by {@link #getEquipItem()})
	 * having this ability (that my father at the market bought...), then see the
	 * code at the bottom.
	 * <p>
	 * Example of that "works":
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>Could apply static effects like auras.</li>
	 * <li>{@link TimedObject}s requires to be added to the {@link GModality}:
	 * example a "chest" dealing a nova explosion each N seconds</li>
	 * <li>{@link GEventObserver}: a belt dropping moneys every time some damage is
	 * received, or a ring healing the creature upon dropping moneys.</li>
	 * <li>An item could modify some attribute(S) depending on some factors (i.e.:
	 * bonus in LifeMax equal to 10% of current money's amount). An implementation
	 * could be being a {@link TimedObject} that, each seconds, subtract the
	 * "previous value(s)" (initially 0 and used as a "cache") and add the newly
	 * computed value(s) to the {@link BaseCreatureRPG}'s attribute(s), that will be
	 * saved in that "cache".</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * NOTE: to obtain the {@link BaseCreatureRPG} which this equipment's ability is
	 * applied on, use the following chain code:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * <code>
	 * BaseCreatureRPG creatureHolder;
	 * creatureHolder = {@link #getEquipItem()}.getBelongingEquipmentSet().getCreatureWearingEquipments();
	 * // use creatureHolder ... , but beware of nulls 
	 * 
	 * // or the shorthand
	 * creatureHolder = {@link #getEquipItem()}.getCreatureWearingEquipments();
	 * // use creatureHolder ... , but beware of nulls
	 * </code>
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * See {@link EquipmentItem#getBelongingEquipmentSet()} and
	 * {@link EquipmentSet#getCreatureWearingEquipments()} for further
	 * informations.>
